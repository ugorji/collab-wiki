""" This page is not complete. The complete list of actions is no longer documented. 
We now have about 40 actions for different things. """

Actions are high level functions.

An action completely handles the work for a request.

Basically, actions form a part of the URL link, which is typically of the form
 * `` __contextpath__ / oxy / __action__ / __section__ / page #anchor ``

By having the action be a part of the request URL, it is easy to apply container 
managed security. You can easily restrict access to any action via standard 
webapp security pattern matching

== Writing your own Custom Actions

You can create a custom action, by implementing net.ugorji.oxygen.web.WebAction, and configuring
it within the oxywiki.properties file.

Ensure that you do not conflict with the names of builtin actions. To do that, you can
prefix your action names with something unique e.g. my_ .
{{{
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.action.my_sayhello = my.actions.SayHelloAction
}}}
