
Oxygen Wiki is designed to support multiple languages.

It comes built in with support for English and Japanese. 
~~ The Japanese localization is courtesy of Yusuke Yamamoto. ~~

== How does it work? (how to switch language)

When a user's request is being processed, a locale (languge) is inferred, and used
for showing the UI. 

The language a user is presented with is decided using the flow below:
* If the user explicitly set a language just for that session, via some menu, that language is used
* Else if the user has saved a preferred language in the user preferences, that language is used
* Else if the user's browser has a preferred language set, that is used
* Else the default for the wiki engine is used

This shows the multiple ways at which one can set the language.

''Note: The user defined locale can be changed, and stored, from the __ user preferences __
screen.''


== Configuration

A set of supported locales, and a default locale, can be configured
either at the wiki engine level (in oxywiki.properties) or can be
overridden for a given section (in oxywiki-$sectionname.properties). 

The values configured are the standard locale descriptions e.g. en,
en_US, fr, etc.

This is done by configuring the value in the oxywiki.properties file
 * Configuring default locale
   * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.locale
     * e.g. net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.locale = en
 * Configuring supported locales
   * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.locales.supported
     * e.g. net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.locales.supported = en, fr

== Porting to another language
To support other languages, you need to do the following:
 * Create net.ugorji.oxygen/wiki/WikiResources_$language.properties
   * e.g. net.ugorji.oxygen/wiki/WikiResources_fr.properties (to support french)
 * Have this file contain the same set of properties in net.ugorji.oxygen/wiki/WikiResources.properties
   * This file is found in the classpath, under the WEB-INF/classes directory
