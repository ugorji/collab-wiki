= Inline Review 

A blockquote is used to show inline reviews.

Inline Reviews are special, because on the view page, you can toggle them on or off.

They really come in handy, for collaborative editing, since you can put review comments in place.

=== Example 
{{{

Hi there. I think this page is getting too long.\\
If you click ''Show/Review comments'' at the bottom, this will get hidden or shown.\\ 
Maybe split it up into different areas. '''You heard me'''

-|| Bogus -|| blah
 || thanks || yes

}}}

= Reviews (External) 

These are like review comments, which are attached to a page (as opposed to being part of the page).

This allows you comment on a page, or see other comments which have been posted to the page.

A review comments basically has 3 parts
 * Author
 * Date
 * Text of the comment

Review comments, like everything else, can use the full blown Wiki syntax.

'' They show up specially on the view page also (since they use a special CSS class to support them). Consequently, if defining your own template or CSS file, ensure you have a definition for class 'wikireview' ''

= Configuration 

You configure these by editing your oxywiki.properties, or the corresponding oxywiki-$section.properties.

You can configure allowing the reviews to be enabled or disabled.

You can also configure how your reviews are stored.
