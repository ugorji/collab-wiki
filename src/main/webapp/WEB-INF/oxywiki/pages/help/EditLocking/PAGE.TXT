
== Locking against concurrent editing 

If two people try and edit the same wiki page at once some nasty conflicts can occur. 
Without any kind of warning system one of the editors can save the page, which leaves 
the other editor with a message warning them about the conflict. An easy way around 
this is to display warnings for editors that try to start editing wiki pages 
that are already being edited. i.e. the wiki keeps track of pages being edited.

This can be done using the ''editlock'' system. There are three levels
of locking: to ''WARN'', to ''EXCLUSIVE'' and ''NONE'' (turned off).
 
If you configure to '''WARN''', when someone tries to edit a page that
is already being edited, they will be presented with a warning message
asking them to consider waiting until the current editor has finished.

If you configure to '''EXCLUSIVE''', then if some one tries to edit a
page that is being edited they will receive a message saying that the
page is locked and will not be able to edit it until the editor has
finished.

A complication of this feature is that an editing session might be started and 
might not be finished. e.g.:
 * Someone presses edit and then clicks on a link to exit the page without cancelling.
 * The browser window is closed without cancelling.
 * The back button is pressed.
 * Someone starts editing a page and forgets and leaves it open overnight.
This would result in a page having permanent warnings or being permanently locked. 

To prevent this, a time-to-live of a lock is implemented. After a specified 
number of minutes the lock expires. 

Note that the timer restarts when you hit preview. If you are actively 
editing a page and hit preview it is assumed you are still busy and the 
timer starts again. If you leave the page, or exit it for more time than the 
timer allows the edit locking runs out and other people are free to edit the page.

=== Aborting an edit 

For the reasons explained in the timeout description above, you should 
'''always use Cancel''' to cancel an edit if you have enabled edit locking!

== Configuration 

The following are used to configure the edit locking system. These variables 
are set in the oxywiki-$section.properties file.
 * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.ttl
 * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.type

The '''net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.type''' config variable controls the behaviour
of the locking system. This can have the following values:
 * NONE i.e. there is no edit locking. The feature is turned off \
   and nobody is warned or stopped from doing simultaneous edits of a page.
 * WARN  tells Engine to warn anyone trying to concurrently editing \
   a page, with a specified timeout
 * EXCLUSIVE tells Engine to lock a page for the specified amount \
   of time after an edit started. e.g. "`lock 5`" locks a page for 5 minutes.

The '''net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.ttl''' is the time to have a lock last, in milliseconds.

Sample:
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.ttl                     = 1200000
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.edit.lock.type                    = WARN
}}}

== Example Interaction 

Sample interaction of John Miller and Jane Doe...
 * no locking (None): John Miller starts editing a page and Jane  Doe \
   thinks she'll edit the same page. She has no idea that someone else \
   is editing the page so they both edit away and hit save. It doesn't \
   matter who started first and did the most editing, whoever hits \
   ''save changes'' first will have their changes committed and the \
   unfortunate 2nd editor will have to try and merge their changes in or lose them.
 * edit warnings (warn): John  Miller starts editing a page and \
   Jane  Doe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit \
   she'll see a warning telling her that someone else got there first. \
   If she is polite she'll leave the page, but she can still save before \
   John and he may lose his changes.
 * edit locking (EXCLUSIVE): John  Miller starts editing a page and \
   Jane Doe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit she'll \
   see a warning telling her that someone else got there first and the page \
   is locked. She will have to wait for the page to become available.
