== WikiWikiWeb 
A WikiWikiWeb is a collaborative hypertext environment, with an emphasis on easy access to and modification of information. 

You can edit any page by pressing the link at the bottom of the page. 

You are encouraged to edit pages in the sandbox whichever way you like. Please restrain yourself from editing other pages until you feel at home with the ways a wiki works.

To learn more about what a Wiki:WikiWikiWeb is, read about Wiki:WhyWikiWorks and the Wiki:WikiNature. Also, consult the Wiki:WikiWikiWebFaq and Wiki:OneMinuteWiki. 

This wiki is also part of the InterWiki space, which means you can easily refer to a wealth of information available through other public wiki sites.

Good starting points to explore a wiki are
 * Main: Top level page of each section
 * Search: search or browse the database in various ways
 * Index: a list of all pages in the wiki
 * [ Sandbox | sandbox:Main ] - feel free to change this page and experiment with editing

For more help, see the [ Help pages | help:Main ]

== Data Organization

This wiki organizes data in a number of dimensions.

# First, this wiki is a wiki-farm, and has different sections. Look at sections as you would look at folders within your mail application.
# Secondly, each section can organize pages in a hierachy. Thus, you can have pages like {{ StatusReports }}, {{ StatusReports/May2007 }}
# Thirdly, different metadata called tags (otherwise called labels) can be applied to pages. You can then search for pages with specific tags.

This makes the search and cross-cutting organization of the wiki extremely powerful. Especially with the tags, the administrator 
can constrain the allowed tags to a specific subset, or can have them free-form (so anyone can add any tag to a page).

== Best Practices 

Some best practices are written below:

 * Give names which are 
   * Capitalized Words (e.g. Current, First, Animals, Teams, etc)
   * Camel Case words - first letter capitalized (e.g. NovemberIssues, HelpForBeginners, etc)
