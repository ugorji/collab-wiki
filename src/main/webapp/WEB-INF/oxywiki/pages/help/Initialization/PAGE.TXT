Initialization

At initialization, the following properties files are read:
* WEB-INF/classes/net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.config.override.properties (if it exists)
  * ~~ Configuration properties are loaded from here ~~

Also, a plugin is included by default, which reads BSF and initialized 
based on it.

To configure it, create the following files in WEB-INF/classes
* net.ugorji.oxygen.plugin_bsf.pre_init_start.bsf
* net.ugorji.oxygen.plugin_bsf.pre_init_close.bsf
* net.ugorji.oxygen.plugin_bsf.post_init_start.bsf
* net.ugorji.oxygen.plugin_bsf.post_init_close.bsf

~~ These files should be in beanshell format ~~
