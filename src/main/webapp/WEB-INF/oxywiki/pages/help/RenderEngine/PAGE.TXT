
Each section can define a different render engine.

The render engine is what defines how the input stream is translated to an html format.

== Built in Render Engine

This is the DefaultWikiRenderEngine.

It uses the default syntax of this wiki. 

Any other wiki syntax can easily be developed and plugged in.


== Configuration 

You configure these by editing your oxywiki-$section.properties.

Basically, you define the property net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.renderengine

Sample is below:

{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.renderengine                        = net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.DefaultWikiRenderEngine
}}}

== Extension (Plugin) 

It is easy to write your own render engine.

Just provide an extension of the class:
 * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.WikiRenderEngine
   * Just implement the abstract method \\ \
     {{ public abstract void render(Writer out, Reader in, WikiRenderContext context, int maxNumParagraphs) throws Exception; }}

Then, configure it appropriately in the oxywiki-$section.properties file.
