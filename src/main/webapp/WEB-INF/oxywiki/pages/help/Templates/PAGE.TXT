
JSP files are used to implement the views in this wiki.

Each section can define where it finds the jsp files from. 

== Built in template handlers 

The templates can use one of our collection of stylesheets.
 * main style sheet
   * located at ''${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/stylesheets/stylesheet.css''
   * By default, comes with light grey background
   * However, we bundle stylesheet-lightbrown.css, stylesheet-lightgreen.css and stylesheet-lightblue.css
 
You can configure either one to use for your section pages, or create your own (very simply).

== Configuration 

You configure these by editing your oxywiki.properties file, or the corresponding oxywiki-$section.properties.

Samples are below:

{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.engine.name                   = COLLAB
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.basefile             = template.jsp
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.templates            = default
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.stylesheets      = ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/stylesheets/stylesheet.css

}}}

To use the light blue, do something like:
{{{ 
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.stylesheets      = ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/stylesheets/stylesheet.css \
                                            ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/stylesheets/stylesheet-lightblue.css
}}}

== Creating your own jsp templates

You replicate one of the *.jsp files in the WEB-INF/oxywiki/templates/default directory,
put it in your own WEB-INF/oxywiki/templates/$mytemplatename directory,
and configure the templates to look in your directory first.

{{ net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.templates        = $mytemplatename,default }}

Suppose I want to very simply create a different look and feel for a section called '''mycat2'''
 * create the following files:
   * /WEB-INF/oxywiki/templates/mycat2/template.jsp, (and other *.jsp files at will)
 * __ Within oxywiki-mycat2.properties __ 
{{{
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.templates        = mycat2,default
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.stylesheets      = ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/templates/mycat2/stylesheet.css
}}}
 
== Customizing the main builtin template 

The built in template is designed to allow these functions simply:
 * Customize decorations or menus on every page view
   * Top
   * Bottom
   * Left
   * Right
 * Customize colors simply
   * Basically override the general background colors

To create a Top, Left or Right section, just create pages corresponding 
to these names. For example, if you create a page called Left, that page 
will be displayed on the left for every page view. Same thing goes for Right and Top.

To customize colors, you can do the following
 * Create a small stylesheet like below \\ \
{{{
.footer, .titlebar, th, pre, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, 
.breadcrumbs, .leftmenu, .rightmenu, .wikireview, div#oxywiki_view3navwrap {
    background-color: #fff5e8; 
}
}}}
 * Attach this to a page (so that it becomes available online). 
   * For example, let's say you attach this to the Main page of sandbox section. And you call it mystylesheet.css
 * Configure this page as an override for your stylesheet. E.g. within your configuration file for your section (like oxywiki-help.properties), put \\ \
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.stylesheets            = ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/stylesheets/stylesheet.css \
                                                  ${net.ugorji.oxygen.web.base.url}/p/viewattachment/sandbox/Main/mystylesheet.css
}}}
 * Then reload your section


== How the builtin template works 

The built in template works off this model:
 * Make the typical usage fast (do not try to load up details unless requested)

Consequently, when a page is shown
 * It just shows the actual current text 
   * ~~ does not try to load up meta data about the page ~~
   * If attachments are shown, only show link to attachment (do not get meta data like author, comments, etc)
   * If reviews are shown, only show review text (not metadata like author, etc)
 * User can explicitly say 'show details'
   * This then shows details for everything

The reason for this model, is that the speed of getting metadata is dependent on the underlying page provider. However, the typical page
providers already have the text or attachments on disk, but meta data is typically stored elsewhere (e.g. in CVS or Perforce repository, in a DB, etc).

This thus gives a faster view for typical usage.

However, you can configure if
 * You want details to be shown by default
 * You want attachments, page info and reviews to be shown by default
The parameters to set these are:
{{{
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.show.details                    = true
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.show.pageinfo      = false
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.show.attachments   = true
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.show.reviews       = false
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.show.inlinereviews = false
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.show.toplinks      = true
}}}

== Style sheet

At least, the following style classes must be defined. Their names are self-describing:
-|| Styles to define
 || wikicalendartitle
 || wikireview
 || wikinonexistentpage
 || wikiexternallink
 || wikicalendardate
 || wikitoc

The default template also leverages the following:
-|| Leveraged by built-in template
 || breadcrumbs
 || leftmenu
 || rightmenu
 || titlebar
 || pagelayout
 || footer

Some of the other style classes in the oxywiki/stylesheets/stylesheet.css setup
the styles for some builtin macros e.g. code, etc 

These include xml-tag, javascript-comment, etc etc etc.
