
== Using Page Templates

Sometimes, U have this scenario where regularly, you need to create a new page 
based off some standard text. This may happen when you have regular status reports
which must follow a pre-defined format, or otherwise.

Templates come in very handy here, because you can just preload the template, 
then edit the contents for this new page.

The support is very flexible, such that users can create as many templates as they
want, and use that to create pages.

On the edit screen, the templates configured are shown. The user can select any and
pre-load the edit screen with the contents.

== Configuration 

The following are used to configure the templates. You set what the name of the 
parent page of all templates is. Then, all sub-pages of that page will exist as
templates for your edit session. Note that you can also reference pages defined in
other sections for your templates. These variables are set in the 
oxywiki-$section.properties file.
 * net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.pagetemplate.parentpage

{{{ 
# Example: 
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.pagetemplate.parentpage = Templates, help:Examples
}}}

Means if U make the following pages within your section: 
# Templates/T1
# Templates/T2
and the following pages exist in the help section: 
# Examples
# Examples/AsIs
# Examples/Include
# Examples/Java
# Examples/PageIndex
# Examples/Random
Then all of these will be available in the edit screen for you to start a new page with.
