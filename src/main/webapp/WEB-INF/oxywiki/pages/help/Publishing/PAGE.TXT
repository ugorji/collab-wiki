This wiki tries to simulate an environment where pages can be published and unpublished.

When a page is published, it is indexed and can be browsed, searched for, etc. 

When un-published, it just stays there.

It can be listed by folks who look at the allpages action, and can be edited.

By default, you configure which groups have access to publish/un-publish pages.
* With access, a checkbox is presented on the edit screen, for you to change the published flag
