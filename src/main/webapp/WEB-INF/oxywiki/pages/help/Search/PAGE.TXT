
=== Overview 

Search can be done on one or more sections.

You can select to do one of the following:
 * Page title search
 * Page contents search
 * last modified search
 * Attachment Name
 * Tags
 * Author
 * Comments
 * Last Modified Date

In addition, the results can be given as a regular web-page, or as an RSS Feed.

=== Backend 

We use Lucene and leverage its built in Query Parser for Searches. 

== Configuration 

You can configure how many results are shown per section, by editing 
your oxywiki-$section.properties.

Sample:
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.search.hits.max                                = 20

}}}

~~ Sometimes, Lucene throws a Lock Not Obtained exception, and it seems to be a bug in 
Lucene. To accomodate, we globally disable lucene locks through this plugin. 
Configure the plugin as above.
