
= RSS

This Wiki supports RSS feeds of the recent changes of the wiki. 
In addition, it also allows you to show the results of any arbitrary search in RSS. This
way, users can track whatever they need to (by constructing a search query with RSS results).

This implementation allows one to
* Subscribe for RSS feeds of recent changes for any number of sections (individually or together or a set thereof)
* Subscribe for RSS feeds of any other arbitrary search. The full gamut of possible searches has this functionality.
