
This wiki was created due to a number of pressing problems we saw in available Java based (Servlet/JSP) Wiki Engines
 * No real sections or sub-webs
 * No hierachy (I really like to organize my pages in folders)
 * Slow search implemetations (searching 50 pages taking over a minute)
 * No real inter-section linking
 * No free ones having all the capabilities we wanted in one package, especially:
   * Page subscription
   * Arbitrary Page subscriptons
   * Different lock levels (no locking, warning, or exclusive locking)
   * Support for AS-IS blocks (good for html, etc)
   * Processing instructions, to allow the writing of pages in different formats
     * Wiki, CSV, HTML, plain, etc

Also, we believe that, by leveraging community-provided software, we could build a much stronger Wiki. 
Consequently, we leverage the following open-source products:
 * JRCS - http://www.suigeneris.org/space/JRCS (for the text diff utility)
 * Jakarta Apache libraries
   * Lucene - http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene (for indexing and searching)
   * FreeMarker - http://freemarker.org/ (for templates we evaluate at runtime)
   * Commons (logging, fileupload) - http://jakarta.apache.org/commons
 * JavaCC - https://javacc.dev.java.net/ (for the parser)
 * ROME - for supporting the RSS action and RSS macro

Optionally, we also support plugging in the following
 * EhCache - http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/ (if users want to use ehcache for the caching manager)
 * JRCS - http://www.suigeneris.org/space/JRCS (if users want to use the JRCS page provider)
 * Radeox - http://www.radeox.org (We provide an intregration point, to allow the transparent use of radeox-based macros AS-IS within collab)
 * JHLabs Imaging - http://www.jhlabs.com/ (the captcha support leverages this)
 * Bean Scripting Framework - http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/ (for the ~~optional~~ script plugin)
   * Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org (if users want to embed scripts using groovy)
   * BeanShell - http://beanshell.org (if users want to embed scripts using BeanShell)
