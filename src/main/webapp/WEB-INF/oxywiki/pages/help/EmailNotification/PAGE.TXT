
You can subscribe
 * to a specific page, or 
 * to all pages matching a given regular expression (across all sections)

== Specific page 

This is done from the edit screen. The steps are as below:
 * Edit a page
 * Add an email address to the subcribers field

Note: You should put in email addresses separated by commas. Example: {{ ugorji@oxygensoftwarelibrary.com, james@somefunkyhost.net }}

Whenever this page is edited, you will get an email notification with the diff of the changes.

== Pages matching a regular expression 

This is done from the user preferences screen:
 * Go to user preferences
 * Set up your preferred username and email address
 * put a regular expression detailing pages to match and get email notification on. Examples are:
   * {{ .* }} - send email when any page is updated

You will get an email notification with the diff of the changes.

''Note that the user preferences apply across the whole engine, so across all sections. Consequently, the matches apply across all sections.''

To subscribe just to pages in a specific section, prefix the regex with {{ $sectionname/ }}. Examples are:
 * regular expression(s)
   * {{ sandbox/.* }} - send email when any page is in sandbox section is updated
   * {{ sandbox/Ma.* }} - send email when any page is in sandbox section, starting with ''Ma'', is updated
   * {{ sandbox:Upgrade/.*|users:.* }} - send email after edit/saving of pages starting with __ Upgrade/ __ in the __ sandbox __ section, or any page in the __ users __ section.

== Configuration 

To configure this, you will add email notification as one of your listeners.

~~ Email can either be sent in html or text format. ~~

{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.listener.email          = net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.extensions.WikiEmailNotifier
}}}

The following properties will also apply for email notifications
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.email.supported                 = false
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.email.smtp.host                 = localhost
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.email.sender                    = someguy@localhost
# this value can either be html or text
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.email.format                    = html
}}}

== Minor edit 

When making an edit (attachment, page edit, page create, review add, etc), you have the option of making the change a minor edit.

The Email Notification listener will only broadcast an email if
 * Subscribers are present
 * The minor edit flag was not set for the change.

This way, you can allow only changes you want folks to be aware of, to get spammed out.
