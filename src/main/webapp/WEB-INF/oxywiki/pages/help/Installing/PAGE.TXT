== Simple Installation 

The oxywiki distribution is pre-configured for a seamless installation. To do this:
 # Download the distribution (oxywiki.war OR oxywiki-no-lib-jars.zip). This contains
   * README.txt (this file)
   * Contents of the web application 
   * ~~ If oxywiki.war, it also contains all dependent lib jars in WEB-INF/lib/ ~~
 # Unzip it into a directory
 # ~~ If you downloaded oxywiki.war, skip this step. ~~ \\ \
   Download the third party jars which oxywiki depends on. Put them in the WEB-INF/lib directory \
   after unzipping the zip archive, or on the classpath of your server (so it can be shared with other applications). These are
   * Mandatory
     # oxy-jdk-extensions.jar
     # oxy-common.jar 
     # oxy-markup.jar 
     # oxy-wiki-classes.jar 
     # oxy-wiki-resources.jar 
     # freemarker.jar
     # lucene-core.jar,
     # org.suigeneris.jrcs.diff.jar
     # commons-logging.jar,
     # commons-fileupload.jar, (1.1 has a bad bug, causing all filenames to be lowercase)
     # commons-io.jar
     # rome.jar (only if using rss macro, and for the RSS action)
   * Optional
     # radeox_base.jar (only if leveraging radeox macros)
     # ehcache.jar (only if using ehcache as your caching provider, or if the jcaptcha action is configured)
     # bsf.jar (only if using the script macro - some people disable this for security reasons)
     # bsh.jar (only if using the script macro - and leveraging beanshell as your scripting engine)
     # jhlabs-imaging.jar (only if enabling captcha, to prevent spam, and ensure humans post entries to the wiki)
     # jdom.jar (only if using rss macro - rss macro uses rome.jar which internally uses jdom.jar)
 # Deploy the directory to your web application server (e.g. tomcat, resin, weblogic, websphere)
   * e.g. deploy with the context-path /oxywiki onto ``http://localhost:7001``
 # Look up the startup page
   * in example above, it is ``http://localhost:7001/oxywiki/``

== Extended configuration during installation 

A couple of configuration properties allow you specify where data is written to by the wiki. These are the 
more important startup configuration parameters.
 :: net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.persistence.dir :: The directory which config, runtime and pages are stored.

 :: net.ugorji.oxygen.config.dir :: defaults to ${net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.persistence.dir}/config
 :: net.ugorji.oxygen.runtime.dir :: defaults to ${net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.persistence.dir}/runtime
 :: net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.provider.filesystem.location.base.prefix :: defaults to ${net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.persistence.dir}/pages

You start up configuring oxywiki for your environment, from this file. 
To do this, update the {{ WEB-INF/classes/net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.config.override.properties}} .
In here, you specify, at a minimum, the persistence directory. E.g.
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.persistence.dir = /home/oxywiki/persistence
}}}
By default, the config, runtime and pages directory are created here. You can also specify
these explicitly, as shown above.

Also, you may want to create an about page for your instance, and configure it in the oxywiki.properties.
 :: net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.about.page :: defaults to help:About

-- Ugorji
