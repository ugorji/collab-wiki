== Plugins (extensibility) 

 * Macros - for embedding arbitrary dynamically generated content into wikipages
   * Processors are also supported through this, so that one can embed different formats into wiki pages (e.g. html, xml, java source code, etc)
 * Providers - for getting content from different sources. ''Built in providers support directories, jars, perforce, rcs''
 * Templates and skins (e.g. single template, different stylesheets)
 * Actions - to plugin different high level actions
 * Logging - so log messages can go anywhere (e.g. leverage jakarta commons logging framework)
 * Internationalized - so that it can easily be configured for different languages. We now support English and Japanese.
 * Listeners - so you can be notified of events (like when page is saved, etc). We bundle an email listener, so that users can be notified when pages are modified.

== Configuration 
 * Simple property files
 * each section has seperate configuration file (and inherits from overall engine). This way, each section (or category) can have its own different look or style.

== Portlet and Servlet Support
 * The Wiki is designed so that it can be used as a standard web application, or as a jsr-168 compliant portlet. 

== Internationalization
 * Pre-built support for English and Japanese
   * Japanese localization - courtesy of Yusuke Yamamoto

== Environment 

 * Written in JAVA (http://java.sun.com/), so it runs on all major operating systems and web application containers
   * Linux/UNIX, Mac OS X, Windows, etc
   * Tomcat, Resin, Weblogic, Websphere, etc
 * simple to install
 * '''no need''' for external stuff. We leverage java packages which do these for us. So no need for external stuff like:
   * diff (1.2)
   * rcs, cvs, etc
   * PHP
   * SQL or other database 
 * Leverage best-of-breed open-source software
   * JRCS - http://www.suigeneris.org/space/JRCS
   * JavaCC - https://javacc.dev.java.net/
   * Lucene - http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/index.html
