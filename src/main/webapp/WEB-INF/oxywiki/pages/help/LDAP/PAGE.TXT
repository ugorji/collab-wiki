
= LDAP

This wiki supports LDAP integration.

This wiki does not manage users. It allows you leverage whatever authentication and 
authorization mechanism you want on the wiki. 

Many organizations already have an ldap directory server which they use to manage the 
authentication and authorization of their users.

To give some support for that, we have built in an ldap view. This way, users can configure
the ldapfind action as their user shortcut, and have links to usernames (author names)
go to the page with this view.

== Schema mapping

By default, we assume a schema mapping that uses the following names for attributes.
Most of these are self explanatory. If your schema names it a different attribute, 
please configure it as shown under configuration.

-|| Attribute -|| Meaning
 || rdn  || The key used to define a distinguished name. 
 || cn         || Common Name
 || username || 
 || telephoneNumber || 
 || title || 
 || id || unique integer id e.g. employeeNumber
 || department || 
 || departmentNumber || 
 || organization || 
 || street || 
 || city || 
 || st || 
 || postalCode || 
 || co || 
 || manager || 

== Configuration

The configuration is simple. In your oxywiki.properties or oxywiki-$section.properties,
put the values as below.

{{{
# This is the URL 
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.url = ldap://ldap.myserver.com/dc=myserver,dc=com?uid?(objectClass=*)
# This is the key which defines the relative distinguished name
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.rdn_key = uniqueIdentifier
# This is the root. Sometimes, we construct a dn by taking the rdn_key, a value and the dnroot
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.dn_root = ou=people,dc=MetaView,dc=bea,dc=com
# This is the key which the ldap server stores the username as
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.username_key = uid

# The following two are optional. Many organizations do not require authentication to allow
# users see information from the ldap directory. However, if your organization requires
# access to connect to the ldap server, then configure accordingly as below
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.user =
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.password =

# Configure your schema overrides below.
# You at least need to configure rdn, and maybe id. Sample below.
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.schema.rdn = uniqueIdentifier
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.schema.id = employeeNumber
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.ldapfind.schema.organization = ou

}}}
