
You can plug in listeners, which get notified on different events.

The events generally fall into:
 * PAGE_SAVED
 * PAGE_DELETED
 * ATTACHMENT_SAVED
 * ATTACHMENT_DELETED
 * REVIEW_SAVED
 * REVIEW_DELETED
 * MINOR_EDIT_FLAG_KEY

== Configuration 

You configure these by editing your oxywiki.properties file, or the corresponding oxywiki-$section.properties.

Basically, any property which starts with "net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.listener." denotes a listener.

Samples is below:
{{{
net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.listener.email = net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.extensions.WikiEmailNotifier
}}}

== Extension (Plugin) 

It is easy to write your own listeners.

Just implement net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.WikiEventListener, and add a line to the oxywiki-$section.properties file.
