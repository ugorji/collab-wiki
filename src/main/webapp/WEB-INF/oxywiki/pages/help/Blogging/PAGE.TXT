
From the wikipedia, a blog (or weblog) is defined as below:

~~ A weblog (usually shortened to blog, but occasionally spelled web
log) is a web-based publication consisting primarily of periodic
articles (normally in reverse chronological order). ~~

This wiki provides blogging functionality, by leveraging the content
management abilities it has, and adding the ability to see a calendar
with access to pages updated in a given day, month or year.

So you create your pages as normal, and blogging capabilities are
implicit, and we add chronological browsing to complete the blogging
experience. 

= Configuration 

You will need to put the calendar is a place where it is always
available on the page. 

This can be done by leveraging the template provided.

For example, the default templates take a parameter, which will put
the calendar, either in the left column, or the right column.

You configure these by editing your oxywiki.properties, 
or the corresponding oxywiki-$section.properties.

The calendar also leverages the property net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.show.details, to
know whether to show details on pages or not.

Note that we only support a calendar view if all the details of the pages 
are indexed. If not, then the dates in the Lucene Index will not be in sync 
with the dates from the repository, causing problems on the calendar view.

Sample to configure things which affect the display:
{{{
  # either Left or Right. Anything else is ignored, and calendar is not shown
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.template.jsp.calendar.location  = Left
  net.ugorji.oxygen.wiki.index.details                   = true
}}}
