
== Using Page Drafts

Sometimes, you do not want to register multiple changes on a page, but want to save your
work temporarily, to continue at a later time.

Page Drafts come in handy here. The pages are not committed to the repository, but are saved
off in a temporary place, and are re-loaded from there the next time you want to make a change.

This is only enabled by configuration. When page drafts are supported, you must configure your 
cache manager to be an instance of OxygenPersistentCacheManager. Basically, the cache should not
be cleared when the server is shutdown.

By default, page drafts are supported on all sections, except sandbox.
