Collab (Oxygen Wiki) is a high-performance enterprise collaboration platform, designed around the popular "wiki" concept. 
It runs on any servlet 2.3 or above container.

The help comes packaged as a bundled section, so you can get more detailed information about using "collab" from [help:Main].

We did a comparative study of some of the more popular free and commercial wiki products on the market.

The must-have and desirable features of wiki's, which only a number of available ones claim to have, are reproduced below. 
Collab possesses all of them.

=== Must-Have Features 


 * **Wiki Markup**. Support wiki markup: bold, italic, fixed-width, bullets, tables, headings, embedded images, line breaks, horizontal lines, preformatted text, external hyperlinks, !CamelCase links to wiki pages, etc.
 * **Attachments**. Allow arbitrary documents to be uploaded and referenced via links.
 * **RSS Feed**. Publish recent changes to RSS.
 * **PERFORCE integration**. Use PERFORCE as backing store for documents.
 * **Change management**. View changes to entire wiki or on a per-page basis. Allow changes to be viewed as diffs, support reversion of pages, deletion of pages.
 * **User management**. Allow users to log in to the wiki for identification purposes.
 * **Indexing**. Maintains a searchable index of all pages in the wiki.

=== Desirable Features 

 * **Email notification**. Allow users to subscribe to pages and receive notifications of changes by email.
 * **Customizable style**. Allow customization of look via stylesheets or templates.
 * **HTML Editing**. Allow for pages that are edited directly in HTML instead of wiki markup.
 * **External editing**. Allow pages to be edited in an external editor (like emacs) rather than in an error-prone HTML form.
 * **History**. Optionally display a short history that can be used to navigate among recently accessed pages.
 * **Favorites**. Optionally display a short list of links to bookmarked wiki pages.
 * **Nested Hierarchy**. Allow pages to be created in "sub directories" to help avoid name collisions. 
 * **Escaping !CamelCase**. Allow !CamelCase text to be escaped so it doesn't form a link to a wiki page.
 * **Customizability**. API for hacking the wiki, integrating non-wiki content sources into wiki pages, etc.
 * **Printer-friendly Page**. Allow user to select a "printer-friendly" version of a page that strips away navigation/edit decorations.
